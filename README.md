Sample GNU COBOL Programs Tied to my Blog
I hope these programs will help someone get started in using GNU COBOL and CYGWIN.
The purpose is to give the public a list of programs and scripts they can put to use immediately.

Thanks for checking this repository out. Best of luck to you in using CYGWIN and COBOL.
