COBOL Program Naming Convention Documentation Template

1. Purpose
This document defines the naming convention for COBOL programs used by the [Your Company Name] IT department. Consistent naming improves program identification, maintenance, and documentation.

2. General Rules
* Program names must be 8 characters or fewer.
* Use uppercase letters and numbers only.
* The name structure should clearly indicate the application area and the function.
* Avoid special characters (no underscores, dashes, spaces).

3. Name Structure
Format: [AAA][FFF][N]
* AAA – 3-character application or system code (e.g., PAY for Payroll)
* FFF – 3-character function or process code (e.g., UPD for Update, RPT for Report)
* N (optional) – 1-2 digit sequence number or environment code (e.g., 1, T for Test)
Examples:
* PAYUPD1 – Payroll Update Program 1
* INVRPT2 – Inventory Report Program 2
* ARLDT – Accounts Receivable Load Test

4. Prefix Standards

9. Change Control
* Any new naming conventions or exceptions must be approved by the [Application Manager/Tech Lead].
* Changes to existing program names require a code review and update of related documentation.
