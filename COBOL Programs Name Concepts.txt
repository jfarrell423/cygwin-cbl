 COBOL Programs Name Concepts

Absolutely! COBOL program naming conventions can vary by company or system, but there are many common patterns used across IT departments, especially in mainframe environments. Here’s a practical guide to what you’ll typically see:

1. General Structure
Most IT shops use a fixed-length or predictable format for COBOL program names, often 7 or 8 characters (to fit legacy system constraints, like mainframe PDS member names).
Typical format:
tttsssss or XXXNNNNN
* ttt or XXX — Type or application code
* sssss or NNNNN — Sequence or function code

2. Prefixes by Type
* PRO – Production programs
* DEV – Development programs
* TST – Test programs
* UTL – Utility programs
* BAT – Batch programs
* ONL – Online/interactive programs

3. Application or System Codes
Many organizations start the program name with a short application identifier, e.g.:
* PAY – Payroll
* INV – Inventory
* HRP – Human Resources Payroll
* GL – General Ledger
* ORD – Order Processing

4. Function Suffixes
The rest of the name describes the function or a unique ID. This could be:
* Numbers: PAYR001 (Payroll Report 1)
* Mnemonics: ORDENTR (Order Entry)
* Module type: GLUPDT (General Ledger Update)
* Process type: ARLOAD (Accounts Receivable Load)

6. Mainframe & JCL Considerations
* 8 characters max for PDS member names (hence most COBOL program names are ? 8 characters).
* Sometimes, names will match the corresponding JCL job or PROC for easier tracking.

7. Other Practices
* Numeric suffixes for related programs (ORD001, ORD002…).
* Underscores are rarely used due to mainframe constraints.
* Some teams use a single letter at the end to denote environments:
o P = Production
o T = Test
o D = Development
(e.g., PAYR001P)

8. Documentation & Standards
Most organizations have an internal document listing required program naming standards. If you’re joining a team, always check for their specific guidelines.

Quick Reference
* 8 characters or less
* Start with system/app/type code
* Use meaningful mnemonics or numbers for function
* No special characters (spaces, underscores, etc.)
* Keep it consistent!
